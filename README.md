# ProdigyInfoTech_Task_1
This project is part of Prodigy Infotech’s Data Science Internship – Task 1.
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a continuous and categorical variable using a histogram and a bar chart.

For this task, a World Development Indicators Dataset was used to analyze and visualize population distribution across different countries.This dataset contains records of population from the year 1960 to 2024.


## 🎯 Objective
- Load and preprocess a real-world dataset  
- Visualize data distribution using:
  - Histogram (continuous variable)
  - Bar chart (categorical comparison)
- Understand population patterns across countries

- ## 🌍 Dataset Details
- Source: World Bank – World Development Indicators (WDI)
- Indicator Name: Population, total
- Indicator Code: SP.POP.TOTL
- Time Period: 1960 – 2024
- File Name: Population_task_1.csv

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
